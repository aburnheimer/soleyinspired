				Before I knew what art was, I was drawing on the walls. Art is such a part of who I am that I sometimes find myself opening and closing my hands, splaying my fingers wide in my inherent need to create. 
				</p>
				<p id="para">
				I studied ceramics at University of the Arts in Philadelphia and special effects at Make-Up Designory in L.A. I worked as bartender, barista, makeup artist, face painter, and floral designer before I decided that being a part-time artist wasn&apos;t enough for me. I now fill my time with ceramics, jewelry, and the occasional marriage of the disciplines. Recently, I have been studying Raku. Its immediacy and unpredictability is so refreshingly different that it adds a newfound anticipation every time I open the kiln.

				My love of the raw, almost primitive nature of clay and my keenness for all things technological is the basis of my rustic industrial aesthetic. I am drawn to duality and the play of opposites: the mix of old and new, the contrast of matte versus gloss, raw and polished. Clay and metals provide the opportunity to play with perception, the appearance of weight or solidity without actually being so, the illusion of flexibility from materials that are rigid, delicacy where there is strength. I focus on form, proportion, and texture to create dimension and depth. I use counterbalance and asymmetry to keep the observer engaged. I want the eye to move through and around and back again.
